# swiftPhotoDemo
Accessing Photos from within a Swift App and Presenting a Selected Image
* In this app you can simply tap a button which will bring up the iOS device's Photo's.
* The User can select the image they want to display, and the device will switch back to the Photo Demo app.
* I'm building an Instagram clone, so this will play into that at a later date.
