# swiftPhotoDemo
Accessing Photos from within a Swift App and Presenting a Selected Image
* In this app you can simply tap a button which will bring up the iOS device's Photo's.
* The User can select the image they want to display, and the device will switch back to the Photo Demo app.
* I'm building an Instagram clone, so this will play into that at a later date.

* This will bring up the devices permission question. You can select that it's ok to access the devices photos.  

* You can then select the photo that you want to display.

* Once you select the image, it will go from the devices photo roll back into the photo demo app.

* That's a mighty nice photo!
